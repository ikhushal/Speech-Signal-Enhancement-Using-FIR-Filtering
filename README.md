# Speech-Signal-Enhancement-Using-FIR-Filtering
This project focuses on enhancing speech signals by reducing unwanted noise using spectrum analysis and filtering techniques. The primary objective is to improve speech quality by applying a low-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter to remove high-frequency noise while preserving essential speech components.

Key Highlights
✅ Speech Recording – Capturing audio at 44.1 kHz with 16-bit mono format.
✅ Noise Reduction – Using FIR filtering to remove unwanted high-frequency noise.
✅ Signal Processing – Applying MATLAB-based filtering algorithms for speech enhancement.
✅ Visualization – Comparing original vs. enhanced signals using time-domain plots and spectrogram analysis.

This project demonstrates how advanced signal processing techniques can improve speech clarity, making it valuable for applications in telecommunications, voice recognition, and audio enhancement.
